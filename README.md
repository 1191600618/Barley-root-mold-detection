When growing barley in plant factories, we found that the roots of barley and its tendency to grow mold may be due to the planting density, which I call the "planting curse"

To eliminate these molds, our engineers can only use expensive biological agents, but biological agents are more expensive than barley!

To reduce costs and provide a detection method for subsequent researchers to detect mold in barley roots, we constructed YOLO-DDS for the detection of mold in barley roots
